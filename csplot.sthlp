  where {it:indepvar} is the treatment-variable and {it:varlist} are the control variables.
{p_end}


{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:csplot} simply plots the amount of common support,
declining with each consecutively added control variable out of {it:varlist}.
{p_end}
{pstd}
The results are also returned in the matrix {it:r(results)}.
{p_end}

{pstd}
  {cmd:csperc} calculates common support and returns the result in {it:r(cs_perc)}. (Might help someone as there was no easy way to do that before.)
